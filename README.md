# bad-foxes
A silly little 3-file website that creates breaking bad foxes.

## API Usage
This website uses apis from this [public api repository](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) for its content.

Specifically, credit to [breaking-bad-quotes](https://github.com/shevabam/breaking-bad-quotes) and [randomfox.ca](https://github.com/xinitrc-dev/randomfox.ca) for the two apis I used.

## Trigger warning
If you aren't aware, breaking bad quotes are sometimes graphic. Probably don't open this page if you're under 16.
